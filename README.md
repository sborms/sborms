## Professional

📊 Typically acts the role of a **data scientist/AI engineer** but also have been pivoting into **web development** lately (Django + Next.js).

⚡ Areas of interest to solidify my skill set in include data storytelling, football analytics, MLOps, NLP, and web design.

✍️ Sometimes writes about the above and more on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sborms).

### Research

🎓 Holds a joint PhD in Finance & Business Economics from the Université de Neuchâtel and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Please don't call me doctor.

📝 Published a couple of [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bvk7MPoAAAAJ) about sentiment analysis of textual data and the usefulness of it in time series modeling. Is it useful? It depends.

## Personal

🎸 Likes music from Interpol, New Order, The Cure, The National, The Smile, Khruangbin, Nicolas Jaar, RHCP, Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, John Frusciante, Fontaines D.C., QOTSA, ... and more esoteric stuff. Check out some [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/1118114488) I've made.
