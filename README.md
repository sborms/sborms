## Professional

📊 I am a freelance data professional, typically acting the role of **data scientist**.

⚡ My main learning focus is to expand my skill set in data storytelling, football analytics, MLOps, and NLP.

✍️ I sometimes write about the above and more on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sborms) and my [blog](https://samborms.com/writings/).

## Personal

🏠 Lives in Brussels, but likes the occasional travel.

🎸 Spotify's 2021 to 2023 Wrapped lists disclosed Interpol, New Order, The Cure, The National, Nicolas Jaar, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes and John Frusciante as the music I seem to be most into. Will 2024 bring something different?

⚽ Enjoys playing and/or watching sports, especially (indoor) football, running, tennis, cycling, and martial arts.

## Research

🎓 In 2020, I obtained a joint PhD in Finance & Business Economics from the Université de Neuchâtel and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. 

📝 My research was about sentiment analysis of textual data and the usefulness of it in time series modeling. These are the published papers I have worked on:

- [Econometrics meets sentiment: An overview of methodology and applications](https://doi.org/10.1111/joes.12370)

- [The R package sentometrics to compute, aggregate and predict with textual sentiment](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v099.i02)

- [Daily news sentiment and monthly surveys: A mixed-frequency dynamic factor model for nowcasting consumer confidence](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2021.11.005)

- [Semi-supervised text mining for monitoring the news about the ESG performance of companies](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-66891-4_10)

- [The Economic Policy Uncertainty index for Flanders, Wallonia and Belgium](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3580000)
