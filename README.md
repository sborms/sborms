## Professional

📊 Typically acts the role of **data scientist/AI engineer** but recently also had strong exposure to **web development** (Django + Next.js).

⚡ Areas of interest to deepen my skill set include data storytelling, football analytics, MLOps, NLP, and web design.

✍️ Sometimes writes about the above and more on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sborms).

### Research

🎓 Holds a joint PhD from the Université de Neuchâtel (Finance) & the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Business Economics). Just don't call me doctor.

📝 Published [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bvk7MPoAAAAJ) about sentiment analysis of textual data and the usefulness of it in economic time series modeling. Is it useful? It depends.

## Personal

🏠 Lives in Brussels and fancies the occasional travel (who doesn't?).

🎸 Likes music from Interpol, New Order, The Cure, The National, The Smile, Khruangbin, Nicolas Jaar, RHCP, Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, John Frusciante, QOTSA, ... and more esoteric stuff. Check out some [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/1118114488) I've made.
