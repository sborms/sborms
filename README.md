# Hello 👋

Is it me you're looking for? Probably not, but while you are here let me tell you a bit about myself.

In case you'd like to reach, one of these platforms is best:

## Professional

📊 I am a freelance data professional, typically acting the role of **data scientist**. Lately, I have been pivoting into **web development** using primarily Django and Next.js, though I don't intend to leave the world of data and AI behind just yet. 😎

⚡ I would like to expand or solidify my skill set in data storytelling, football analytics, MLOps, and NLP.

✍️ I sometimes write about the above and more on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sborms) and my [blog](https://samborms.com/writings/).

## Personal

🏠 I live in Brussels, but I do like the occasional travel.

🎸 I mostly listen to (according to Spotify's Wrapped lists since 2021): Interpol, New Order, The Cure, The National, The Smile, Khruangbin, Nicolas Jaar, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and John Frusciante.

⚽ I enjoy playing and/or watching sports, especially (indoor) football, running, tennis, cycling, and martial arts.

## Research

🎓 I obtained a joint PhD in Finance & Business Economics from the Université de Neuchâtel and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 2020. 

📝 I published a couple of [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bvk7MPoAAAAJ) about sentiment analysis of textual data and the usefulness of it in time series modeling.
