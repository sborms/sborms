## Professional

📊 I am a freelance data professional, typically acting the role of **data scientist**. Lately, I have been pivoting into **web development** using primarily Django and Next.js, though I don't intend to leave the world of data and AI behind just yet. 😎

⚡ I would like to expand or solidify my skill set in data storytelling, football analytics, MLOps, and NLP.

✍️ I sometimes write about the above and more on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sborms).

### Research

🎓 I obtained a joint PhD in Finance & Business Economics from the Université de Neuchâtel and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 2020. 

📝 I published a couple of [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bvk7MPoAAAAJ) about sentiment analysis of textual data and the usefulness of it in time series modeling.

## Personal

🏠 I live in Brussels, but I do like the occasional travel.

🎸 I mostly listen to (according to my Spotify Wrapped lists since 2021) Interpol, New Order, The Cure, The National, The Smile, Khruangbin, Nicolas Jaar, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, John Frusciante, Fontaines D.C., and Queens of the Stone Age...

⚽ I enjoy playing and/or watching sports, especially (indoor) football, running, tennis, cycling, and martial arts.
